Next:
research and create a front end layout
Create routes to hit for decks 


I could check and see what happens when I create decks or questions in the admin panel (need associations)
I could start doing some design and quiz flow
I could search for an image or think of an idea to create a theme 
This is not a technically challenging piece, this is a content challenging piece. 
The goal is to create something that people share with their friends and come back for more and more. 
The key is going to be to make this as hard as we possibly can and share with fellow nerds


Matt Lao can think about the tests formats and creating the divs and backgrounds and stuff. I think it makes sense to do harry potter and GOT book questions first and share in reddit? I like that audience and high expecations for difficulty there. I trust Matt Lao to make this content entertaining. 

Game Plan:
Create the complete schema and assocations for all the models from the previous flashcards thing (no prob)
Create the controllers and routes needed to take tests and serve data (and add measurements everywhere we can)
Create the front end to display the content to the user (full screen movie experience)

Lets deploy often, even with just raw json, so we can get used to any weird things in the procfile or whatever
Lets always develop from the very back to the very front
Lets create a great architecture for the site quickly so we can get to the fun part of creating content
